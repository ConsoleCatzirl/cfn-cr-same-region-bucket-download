Description: >
  Add restriction on S3 bucket to only allow download from AWS resources in the same region
  Needs to be periodically re-triggered because the IP address change.
  Data transfers within the same region between AWS resources are free.
  Restricts downloading files from this bucket to only AWS resources (e.g. EC2 , Lambda) within the same region as this bucket.
  This will not allow even the owner of the bucket to download objects in this bucket when not using an AWS resource in the same region!
